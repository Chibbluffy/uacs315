 - [Lecture Slides](https://ualearn.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-1861545-dt-content-rid-14016949_1/courses/45063.201540/Chapter13%20Part%201.pdf)
 - Analysis
	 - Focuses on producing an analysis model of the system which is:
		 - Correct
		 - Complete
		 - Consistent
		 - Verifiable
	 - Goal: Obtain deeper understanding of the requirements
		 - Describe requirements in a way that will result in a maintainable design and implementation
		 - Different from requirement elicitation, focus on structuring and formalizing the requirements
		 - Not necessarily understandable by the client, moves closer to technical side
	 - Forces client and developers to make difficult decisions as early as possible
		 - Resolve difficult issues early in development
 - Analysis Model
	 - Models
		 - Data
		 - Function
		 - Behavior
	 - Types
		 - Functional model
			 - Functionalities of the system
			 - Use cases, scenarios
		 - Object model
			 - Individual concepts manipulated by system and their properties
			 - Classes, components
			 - Static elements of the system
		 - Dynamic Model
			 - Behavior of system
			 - Data flow, activities
	 - Object Identification
		 - Identifying objects (or object classes) is the **most difficult part** of object oriented design
		 - There is no "magic formula" for object identification
		 - Iterative process
		 - Approaches
			 - Scenario-based analysis
				 - Identify objects, attributes, and methods per scenario
			 - Behavioral approach
			 - Grammatical approach
			 - Base identification on tangibles in domain
	 - Class Extraction
		 - Three types
			 - Entity Classes
				 - Concepts and information that live and remain in the software
			 - Boundary Classes
				 - Interactions between system and environment/actors
				 - Generally associated with IO
			 - Control Classes
				 - Computations and Algorithms
		 - Will use UML stereotypes to build a conceptual model
		 - Entity Classes
			 - Extract the entity classes, determine their relationships and find their attributes
			 - Usually the best way to begin step is to use the two stage noun extraction method
				 - Stage 1: Describe the information system in a single paragraph
				 - Stage 2: Identify the nouns in this paragraph
		 - Boundary Classes
			 - Usually easy to identify
			 - Inputs and outputs
			 - System interfaces
		 - Control Classes
			 - Each computation is usually modeled by a control class
				 - Realizes (accomplishes) a use case
		 - UML Notation
			 - ![UML Stereotypes](http://www.sparxsystems.com/enterprise_architect_user_guide/10/images/mvc%20pattern.png)
 - CRC Cards
	 - Class, Responsibilities, and Collaborators
	 - Scenario based technique used to identify classes, their attributes and their interaction with other classes
	 - Group based
		 - Domain Experts
		 - Object Oriented design experts
		 - Facilitator
		 - Scribe
	 - Literally use index cards
	 - Simple example:
		 - ![CRC Template](http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/images/f/f8/CrcCardLayout.jpg)
	 - One Class per card
	 - First pass from description
		 - Identify likely classes
			 - Recall iterative and incremental
		 - Each person should be responsible for a class (card)
		 - Identify responsibilities
			 - Start with the obvious
		 - Identify collaborators
			 - Those classes obviously needed to perform a responsibility
	 - Iterate through a set of scenarios
	 - Customize as needed
	 - Hisorical
		 - Record general description on back of card
		 - Record attributes on back
	 - Other approaches
		 - Lined sticky notes
		 - Whiteboard
		 - Markers
