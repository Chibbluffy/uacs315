 - The Aim of the Requirements Workflow
	 - To answer the question: What must the product be able to do?
	 - Misconception
		 - We must determine what the client wants
	 - Reality
		 - We must determine what the client needs
		 - It is hard for systems analyst to visualize a software product and its functionality
			 - The problem is far worse for the client
		 - A skilled systems analyst is needed to elicit the appropriate information from the client
			 - the client is the only source of this information
 - Determining What the Client Needs
	 - Obtain initial information from the client
	 - Use this initial information as input to the Unified Process
	 - Follow the steps of the Unified Process to determine the client's real needs
 - Overview of the Requirements Workflow
	 1. Gain an understanding of the *application domain* (or *domain*, for short)
		 - The specific environment in which the target product is to operate
	 2. Build a business model
		 - Model the clients business processes
	 3. Use the business model to determine the client's requirements
	 4. Iterate the above steps â†º
 - Definitions
	 - Discovering the client's requirements
		 - *Requirements elicitation* (or *requirements capture*)
		 - Methods include interviews and surveys
		 - Agile is good at this because of frequent contact with the client
	 - Refining and extending the initial requirements
		 - *Requirements analysis*
 - Understanding the Domain
	 - Every member of the development team must become fully familiar with the application domain
		 - Correct terminology is essential
	 - Construct a *Glossary*
		 - A list of technical words used in the domain, and their meanings
		 - Spell out abbreviations and acronyms
 - Business Model
	 - A *business model* is a description of the business processes of an organization
	 - The business model gives an understanding of the client's business as a whole
		 - This knowledge is essential for advising the client regarding computerization
	 - The systems analyst needs to obtain a detailed understanding of the various business processes
		 - Different techniques are used, primarily interviewing
	 - Interviewing
		 - The requirements team meet with the client and users to extract all relevant information
		 - There are two types of questions
			 - Close-ended
				 - Questions require a specific answer
			 - Open-ended
				 - Questions are posed to encourage the person being interviewed to speak out
		 - There are two types of interviews
			 - Structured
				 - Specific, preplanned questions are asked
				 - Frequently close-ended
			 - Unstructured
				 - Questions are posed in response to the answers received
				 - Frequently open-ended
		 - Interviewing is not easy
			 - An interview that is too unstructured will not yield much relevant information
			 - The interviewer must be fully familiar with the application domain
			 - The interviewer must remain fully open-minded at all times
		 - After the interview, the interviewer must prepare a written report
			 - It is strongly advisable to give a copy of the report to person who was interviewed
			 - Providing feedback to the person you interviewed keeps them interested
	 - Other Techniques
		 - A questionnaire is useful when the opinions of hundreds of individuals needs to be determined
		 - Examination of business forms shows how the client currently does business
		 - Direct observation of the employees while they perform their duties can be useful
			 - Video cameras are a modern version of this technique
			 - It can take a long time to analyze the tapes
			 - Employees may view the cameras as an unwarranted invasion of privacy
				 - Should ensure that the employees know you are there
 - High-Level Requirements
	 - Executive document, business case, constraints on the software product and project
		 - Opportunity and Need
			 - Inventory system losing 50% of customer orders, there is $2M extra inventory, need to increase customer orders by 30%
	 - Justification
		 - Scope
			 - Inventory control and order processing
		 - Major Constraints
			 - Budget (if known), Schedule (if known), Risks
		 - Major Functionality
			 - Improved inventory control via automating order and shipping process
			 - Online customer orders
			 - Online Delivery/Shipping control
		 - Success Factor
			 - Must reduce inventory
			 - Must not lose customer orders
			 - Comes from the client's domain
	 - User Characteristics
 - Functional Requirements
	 - Most obvious group, starting point
		 - What should the system do?
	 - Specifies an action that the system must be able to perform as an interaction between the system and its environment
		 - Often expressed in terms of inputs and outputs
		 - Independent from its implementation
	 - Typically handled during requirement and analysis workflows
	 - Business Flow
		 - Functionality needs to be explained in the context of a business flow
		 - Step-by-step scenarios
		 - Use Case
			 - Sequence of actions that a system should perform within the business flow context of the user
			 - Specific steps necessary to accomplish a specific task
	 -  Data & Formats
		 - Determine the application's input and output data
			 - What needs to be entered into the system?
			 - For what purpose?
		 - Some input data may trigger a process
		 - Output may be in form of a query response or a report
		 - Allowed format of information input
		 - Required format of information output
		 - Error messages, warnings, help text
	 - User Interface
		 - How the input and output are presented
		 - Look and Feel
		 - Flow should follow business flow as close as possible
		 - Screenshots, mocking, **rapid prototyping**
	 - Interface with Other Systems
		 - Existing applications, network systems
		 - Some requirements may require a modification in how users operate adjacent systems
			 - Software should adapt to existing systems
			 - Or even adapt the other system to the new software
		 - Dimensions to consider
			 - Transfer of Control
			 - Transfer of data
			 - Receipt of responses
			 - Error recovery, retry capabilities, messages
		 - Should be aware of other systems as early as possible in the process
 - Non-Functional Requirements
	 - ![Non-Functional Requirements Tree](http://usabilitygeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Requirements-Gathering-User-Experience-UX-Non-Functional-Requirements.jpg)
	 - Specifies properties of the software product itself
		 - Platform constraints
		 - Response times
		 - Performance
		 - Reliability
		 - Security
		 - Adaptability
		 - Availability
		 - Transportability
		 - Maintainability
	 - Typically wait until design workflow
	 - Constraints on programming language, OS, tooling, license
 - Requirements Elicitation Activities
	 - Actors identification
		 - Types of users to support
	 - Scenarios identification
		 - Observe users in their daily activities
		 - Concrete example per functionality
		 - Deepen understanding in application domain
	 - Use Cases identification
		 - Generalize scenarios to completely represent the system
		 - Abstraction from scenarios describing all possible cases
		 - This defines the scope of the system
	 - Use Case refinement
		 - Make sure the requirements are complete
		 - Detailed description of behavior
		 - Handle error and and exceptional conditions
	 - Use Case relationship identification
		 - find dependencies between use cases
		 - Factor out common functionality
		 - Ensure requirements are consistent
	 - Non-Functional Requirements Identification
		 - Agree on aspects visible to user
		 - Performance
		 - Documentation
		 - Resource
		 - Consumption
		 - Quality
