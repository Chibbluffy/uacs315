**Here's the format we're going to use in 315:**

**Use Case:** _Use case name_

**Context:** _Brief Description_

**Actors:** _Any Actors involved_ 

**Main Success Scenario:**

_Step by Step Instructions for Successful Use-Case_

- Sometimes common steps in multiple use-cases can be put in their own seperate use-case, where we can extend other use cases. (See Perform Transaction use-case in the slides)

Huseyin performed an in-class demo for VPP where he created a simple use-case diagram with the items in the Lab Slides.

Finally Huseyin went over Git in Eclipse one more time.
