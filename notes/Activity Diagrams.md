#CS 315 - Activity Diagrams Lab
## September 23, 2015

Use the same description from the the Use Case Lab on 9/21 (ATM Example).

Creating the Streotype Class Diagram

- We need:
	- Customers
	- Accounts
	- the ATM
	- Menu
	- Deposit Controller
	- Withdrawal Controller
	- Receipt

We then have to determine the types of each of these classe (boundary, control, entity class).

|Class|Type|
|-----|----|
|Account|Entity|
|Deposit Controller|Controller|
|Withdrawal Controller|Controller|
|ATM|Controller|
|Menu|Boundary|
|Receipt|Boundary|
|Transaction Controller|Controller|

* **Note**: 
	* The Customer is not a class, it iteracts with the system.
	* The Transaction Controller is a parent class of the Withdrawal Controller
	* The Transaction Controller is a parent class of the Deposit Controller.

You can see the complete diagram in Huseyin's slides on BlackBoard.

Huseyin then went and did a demo and how to do it in Visual Paradigm.

Huseyin went though how to do an Class Diagram in Visual Paradigm and how to implement them the use cases that were turned in with Assignment 1.

* Every use case will have it's own activity that has step by step instructions on how to get from beginning to end.
