##Chapter 4: Software Teams

 - Understand what the Client needs
	 - Example
		 - A product must be completed within 3 months, but 1 person-year of programing is still needed
		 - Solution:
			 - If one programmer can code the product in 1 year, four programmers can do it in 3 months
		 - Nonsense!
			 - Four programmers will probably take nearly a year
			 - The quality of the product is usually lower
 - Software Teams
	 - 3 programmers, deadline is rapidly approaching and code is still incomplete
	 - 3 channels of communication between 3 programmers
	 - Solution: Add a fourth programmer!
	 - But other 3 have to explain in detail:
		 - What has been done?
		 - What is left to do?
	 - Now 6 channels of communication
		 - `(n(n-1))/2`
	 - Brooks' Law
		 - "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later"
		 - The Mythical Man-Month (Fred Brooks, 1975)
 - Democratic Team Approach
	 - ![Democratic Team](http://i.stack.imgur.com/smL1j.png)
	 - Basic underlying concept - egoless programming 
	 - Programming can be highly attached to their code
		 - They even name their modules after themselves
		 - they see their modules as extension of themselves
		 - Encourages team members to find faults in code
		 - A fault must be considered a normal and accepted event
	 - Democratic teams are enormously productive
	 - They work best when the problem is difficult
	 - They function well in a function in a research environment
	 - Management may have difficulties
		 - Democratic teams are hard to introduce into an undemocratic environment
		 - Who's in charge?
		 - Who keeps the team on schedule?
 - Classical Chief Programmer Team
	 - ![Chief Programmer Team](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bc5za.png)
	 - The basic idea behind the concept
		 - Analogy: chief surgeon directing an operation, assisted by:
			 - Other surgeons
			 - Anesthesiologists
			 - Nurses
			 - Other experts, such as cardiologist, nephrologists
		 - Two key aspects
			 - Specialization
			 - Hierarchy
	 - Impracticality of Classical CPT
		 - The chief programmer must be a highly skilled programmer *and* a successful manager
		 - There is a shortage of successful managers
		 - The qualities needed to be a highly successful skilled programmer are unlikely to be found in a successful manager, and vice versa
		 - The *back-up programmer* must be as good as the chief programmer
			 - But he/she must take a back seat (and a lower salary) waiting for something to happen to the chief programmer
			 - Top programmers, top managers will not do not
		 - the *programming secretary* does nothing but paperwork all day
			 - Software professionals hate paperwork
		 - **Classical CPT is impractical**
 - Beyond CP and Democratic Teams
	 - Organization that combines democratic and chief programmer
	 - Models
		 - Positive attitude
		 - Reduce managerial role of chief programmer
	 - Large Projects
		 - The nontechnical side is similar
			 - For even larger projects, add additional layers
	 - Decentralize the decision making process, where appropriate
		 - Useful where the democratic team is good
	 - Table of examples on page 120 of the book

At the end of class, we let the TA know our teams for our semester long project.
